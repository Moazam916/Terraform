1. Terraform version needs to be higher than 1.5.X
2. We have to use terrform import config to import any of exisiting AWS resources. as shown below:
    import {
    to = aws_security_group.my-alb-security-group --> <resource_name>.<local_resource_name>
    id = "sg-016dfd00755bb4f64" --> <ID of exisiting aws resource which needs to be imported using terraform import feature
    }
3. Need to use -genrate-config-out during terraform plan command as listed below:
    terraform plan -generate-rate-config-out="example.tf"
